[Lagom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagom) (pronounced
[ˈlɑ̂ːɡɔm]) is a Swedish and Norwegian word meaning "just the right
amount".

This component library provides just the right amount of components
for my own personal projects. Primarily driven by [FrankCongson.com](https://frankcongson.com/). With theme
support for individually styled projects.

Built using [styled components](https://styled-components.com/).
