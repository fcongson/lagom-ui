# Design Tokens

<Section>
  Design tokens for Lagom UI are found in [Lagom
  Tokens](https://github.com/fcongson/lagom-tokens/pkgs/npm/lagom-tokens), a
  separate package consolidating design decisions to support my brands. It
  provides sensible defaults and feeds into Lagom UI to keep the decisions
  consistent.
